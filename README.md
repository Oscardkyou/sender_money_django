This code is for registering and customizing the admin interface for two models,
UserProfile
 and
Transaction
, in a Django project.

For the
UserProfile
 model, the code creates an admin class
UserProfileAdmin
 that inherits from
admin.ModelAdmin
. This class specifies how the
UserProfile
 model should be displayed in the admin interface.

The
list_display
 attribute is a list of fields that will be displayed in the admin list view for
UserProfile
 instances. In this case, it includes the
get_first_name
,
get_last_name
,
get_email
,
balance
,
iin
,
phone
,
created_at
, and
get_image
 methods, which will be used to display the corresponding values for each instance.

The
search_fields
 attribute is a list of fields that will be used to search for
UserProfile
 instances in the admin interface. In this case, it includes the
user__first_name
,
user__last_name
,
phone
, and
iin
 fields.

The
list_filter
 attribute is a list of fields that will be used to filter
UserProfile
 instances in the admin interface. In this case, it includes the
created_at
 field.

The
get_first_name
,
get_last_name
,
get_email
, and
get_image
 methods are custom methods that return specific values based on the
UserProfile
 instance passed as an argument. These methods are used to customize the display of certain fields in the admin interface. For example, the
get_image
 method checks if the
UserProfile
 instance has an
image
 attribute and, if so, displays an HTML
<img>
 tag with the image URL.

For the
Transaction
 model, the code creates an admin class
TransactionAdmin
 that also inherits from
admin.ModelAdmin
. This class specifies how the
Transaction
 model should be displayed in the admin interface.

The
list_display
 attribute for the
TransactionAdmin
 class specifies the fields that will be displayed in the admin list view for
Transaction
 instances. In this case, it includes the
sender
,
recipient
,
summa
, and
created_at
 fields.

The
search_fields
 attribute for the
TransactionAdmin
 class specifies the fields that will be used to search for
Transaction
 instances in the admin interface. In this case, it includes the
sender__user__first_name
,
sender__user__last_name
, and
summa
 fields.
